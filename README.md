#### Style guide
the idea for this guide is to enable us to write self describing code that anyone can instantly be onboarded into and easily know what they are working with.

#### Naming
** please prefer self-describing names for everything: variables, folders, files, functions, props, types, interfaces, classnames, ids e.t.c **

```tsx
const Wallet = ({ ethBalance, usdcBalance, wberaBalance }:props):JSX.Element => {
  const ethBalanceUsd:number = ethBalanlce * ethPrice;
  /** **/

  return( {/**  **/} )
}
```

#### Folder structure
- folders should be usedd to organize files appropriately, i.e:

```
|src
  |pages
    -page-a
    |sub-folder
      -page-a

  |components
    -component-a
    |sub-folder
      -component-a

  |hooks
    -hook-a

  |utils
    -util-a
    |sub-folder
      -util-a
  
  |assets
    |images
    |icons
    |animations

  |styles
    -style-a
    |sub-folder
  
  |some-other-directory
```


##### Pages
- react does not have a concept of pages and components but we can make it aware that certain components should be traeated as pages and other components as 'components' that build up a page.
- Components that are pages can be identified by using those 'components' as Routes.
- page components should have a default export, i.e:

```tsx
export default function Page(){
  /** **/
}
```

- page components should be created as a section, i.e:

```tsx
export default function Page() {
  return(
    <section id="section-id"> {/** **/} </section>
  )
}
```

##### Components
- components should be created as arrow functions, to create distinction between pages & components that build up pages
- components should be named exports

```tsx
export const Component = ():JSX.Element => {
  return ( { /** **/} )
}
```

- components should also be created as div-s

```tsx
export const Component = ():JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <div id="div-id"> {/** **/} </div>
  )
}
```

##### Styles
- please prefer to use scss over css and/or tailwind
- scss is a powerful tool, it offers mixins(i.e. functions), operations, logic, nested styling, inheritance
- scss also includes warnings for code that might break in future with a css update
- tailwind is not prefreed because we want clean html, a good seperation of concerns as well as design freedom

```scss
// scss nesting
.navbar {
  width: calc(100vw - 4rem);

  .lo1 {
    .item {
      .icon {
        /** **/
      }

      span {
        /** **/
      }
    }
  }

  .lo2{
    /** **/
  }
}
```

```scss
// scss mixins
// mixins are reusable just like functions in JS

@mixin somemixin($variable1, $variable2){
  background-color: $variable1;
}
```

```scss
// scss inheritance
.submit {
  /** **/
  background-color: colors.$success;
}

.cancel {
  @extend .submit;
  background-color: colors.$danger;
}
```

```html
<!-- with scss ✅ -->
<button className="submit">Submit</button>

<!-- with tailwind ❌ -->
<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded shadow hover:bg-blue-600">Submit</button>
```

- for colors, please prefer to use rgba colors over hex:

```scss
// colors ✅
$success: rgba(15, 177, 77, 1);

// colors ❌
$success: #0fb14d;
```

This branch, uiV2, intends to clean us the codebase while using this guide and any other code style guide that may arise in the process while updating the UI to [the new design](https://www.figma.com/design/KGyRB7lsvBsteLYMFgpyOZ/sphereid?node-id=0-1&t=UckZ8jVjfyjNKKBw-1).
